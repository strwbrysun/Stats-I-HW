    "As you know from Data Science 1000, a Jupyter Notebook is a document format which mixes text, mathematical text processing, and programming all in one. You will often see Jupyter Notebooks used to present research in scientific fields, as they allow others to see/run the code and visualize data. They are also useful for online data presentations. We will use them extensively in this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes: \n",
    "\n",
    "If you used the \"upload\" button or another shortcut to open this assignment, please part 1 of this lab, about downloading Jupyter Notebooks from the course website, about opening them in Jupyter and about saving them. Often the use of shortcuts leads to errors in this process - frequently because your files save in a location where you are not expecting them to be. About 18% of students in previous classes have uploaded blank or unreadable notebooks to the course website at least once because of these file errors. The demonstrations available online will help you manage this process so that you don't become a statistic. The first part of the video tutorial for this notebook (part 1) will walk you through the process of downloading .ipynb files and opening them in Jupyter. If you already have the notebook downloaded, open and feel comfortable with this process, you may skip this part.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first notebook will introduce you to the format of Jupyter notebook and prepare you for upcoming assignments. Follow the video recorded instructions, which will walk you through the lab (the lab elements are a large part of the grade for this homework. The sections labeled \"Homework\" you should complete on your own. If you run into any issues, let the course staff know, and we will try to troubleshoot them in office hours. \n",

    "## Assignment Goals (after you've got Jupyter running)\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is a review of the basics. In this assignment, you will learn about variables, datatypes, operators, and a few python programming conventions that you will find useful later in the course. You will also learn about the Markdown text functionality that Jupyter includes. Finally, you will complete some exercises to help refresh the descriptive statistics you have learned in the past and that are part of the first lecture.\n"

    "Text in Jupyter is written in a language called Markdown. All we really need to know is that to type text (instead of code) you tell a cell to be in Markdown mode and simply type text. What is important to remember is that in Markdown there is an *Edit* mode and a *View* mode. The latter takes any text you write and formats it nicely.\n",

    "* After typing, press **shift+enter** to switch from *Edit* mode to *View* mode (shift+enter is a shortcut for pressing the **Run** button). You may also use command (or control) + enter as an alternate shortcut. They do slightly different things but both keyboard shortcuts will execute the cell.\n",
    "* In Markdown, special characters like square brackets, less than and greater than signs, hashtags, asterisks, etc. all have a special meaning and may not display the way you think they will. \n",
